# ARAP implementation


### Usage
Please run the program in release, not debug or else Eigen will throw assertion errors.

Open the source folder as a project in an IDE. (preferably visual studio) Then compile main.cpp.
At execution, there will be a console with very simple instructions on how to operate the program.
By default, object is bunny.obj, to change it, simply change the path inside read_triangle_mesh

If any technical problems are encountered, I included an executable program in
source\out\executable\X64 which only requires a windows machine and a double mouse click to operate.
